## Usage

### A/B Theme Testing integrates with Google Analytics to let you test two or more WordPress themes against each other.

Improve your conversions, reduce bounce rates and increase pageviews without having to get involved in any code.

### Find What Works

You can compare two themes with minor differences, or completely different designs. Distribute your visitors evenly across all the different themes and introduce custom variations to Analytics. You don't need to be an SEO expert, let A/B Theme Testing do the hard work. Then all you have to do is collect the data.

### It Works...We Tried It

We were able to measure the difference between 'get this plugin' and download this plugin', and also the position of buttons, just by using four different WordPress themes with a few different tweaks. We've gone on to improve, support and update this plugin for thousands of users. Give A/B Theme Testing a go and you won't be disappointed – create a more user friendly experience and start making more money.

### New Features

Now includes support for child-themes too. How awesome is that?
