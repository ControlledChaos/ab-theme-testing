A visitor's theme assignment is saved via a cookie and only changes when you disable the plugin or choose different themes to test. It also creates a custom segment in Google Analytics for each theme visitors are assigned. The segment names will be of the format \"Theme Test: THEMENAME\" in Analytics. You can then analyze browsing and buying behavior based upon the custom segments named after the themes selected for testing."
